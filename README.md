# Comparative Genomic Analysis of Phage Susceptibility in Salmonella enterica

## Purpose

This project uses comparative genomics to compare phage-susceptible and non-susceptible Salmonella enterica strains from the same serovar in order to identify differences in gene presence and absence. By finding genes that consistently appear in susceptible strains, this study aims to create a short list of candidate genes that can be tested in future phage susceptibility experiments.

## Data Source
Data was gathered from a previous study:
